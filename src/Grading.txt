Good work!

You did not have blank lines between the first and second 
verses of the song, so I took off one point for that.

Your indentation jumps around.  Consistent indentation is
really important for debugging and code readability, so I
took off one point for that.

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
Everybody does comments slightly differently, but at a minimum
it would have been good to have a comment for the set of
methods that did the verses, and a comment for the set of
methods that did the individual lines within the verses.

You did a good job calling Message() at the end of Message2().
That really helps with efficiency.  You could have gone even
farther with that concept.  Home() always follows Malt(), so
you could have put Home() at the end of Malt().  You then could
have put Malt() at the end of Rat(), because it always follows
Rat(), and so on.  That would have made a more obvious
structure and efficiency to your program.  No points off for
that... just something to keep in mind for the future.
